Important note on the cut efficiency
------------------------------------

The published cut efficiency is computed as a function of the true/simulated energy. To correct the energy spectrum one needs the efficiency as a function of the reconstructed energy, which is not available for various reasons.

The efficiency as a function of reconstructed energy usually is flat down to the energy threshold. The drop of of the efficiency curve as a function of true energy is caused by the trigger, which imposes a sharp cutoff for the reconstructed energies. Due to the finite energy resoultion, events with true energies below the nominal threshold can be reconstructed with energies above the threshold and vice versa. This is reflected by the smearing of the efficiency curve around the trigger threshold.

The flat part of the efficiency curve is not affected by this and is the same for reconstructed and true energy. The best approximation is therefore to extend the flat part down to the threshold.
