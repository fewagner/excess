# Excess Workshop Data Repository
****

Multiple rare event search experiments observe an exponentially rising count rate at low energies. This phenomenon is yet unexplained and the comparision, description and discussion of the experimental observations is the objective of the EXCESS workshop (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1013203/). The following collaborations have provided data for the workshop and/or are represented within the advisory board (alphabetical list):

BULLKID
CONNIE/Skipper-CCD  
CRESST  
DAMIC  
EDELWEISS  
MINER  
NEWS-G  
NUCLEUS  
PhyStat-DM  
RICOCHET  
SENSEI  
SuperCDMS  

For *futher information*, please find the workshops presentations attached to the time table on the Indico page: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1013203/timetable/#20210615.detailed and a compact summary in the top level directory of the data repository.

For *discussions about the data repository*, please use the issue tracker: https://github.com/fewagner/excess/issues

For *scientific discussions*, please reach out to the workshop team and ask for the corresponding Slack channel.

## Usage

In the EnergySpectra notebook, you can find an interactive visualization of the measured energy spectra of the experiments. For using it, either clone the GitHub repository to your local machine, start it in an containerized web-environment with Binder (button on top of Readme) or view the static version directly in GitHub. Alternitively, you can also download the data of indivual experiments from the `data/` directory.

You can always create a new branch and change or add features! If your changes might be useful for the other workshop participants as well, please create an issue in the issue tracker and ask for a merge.
